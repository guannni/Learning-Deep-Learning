# Learning-Deep-Learning

Basically, I'm following the roadmap given by [AMAI, 2022](https://i.am.ai/roadmap/#note). 

The web has already given some materials. The other tutorials or books that I refer to during the learning process are recorded here. As well as some personal notes.

The dates recorded are for personal use.
